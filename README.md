# Epistemic Autarchy (EA)  
**README â€” Version 2025-09**

## Why  
Traditional trauma and diagnostic models (PTSD, ADHD, autism, CPTSD) could not explain boundary-condition cases where **all stabilizing anchors fail at once**.  
**Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)** maps this collapse.  
**Epistemic Autarchy (EA)** was created to show how clarity and adaptation can still emerge after such collapse.  

---

## What  
EA is a **living structural system** for survival and knowledge generation when no external anchors can be trusted.  
It describes how cognition reorganizes itself through internal containment, refusal of collapse, and abstraction.  

---

## How to Read  
- Treat EA as a **conceptual framework**, not a therapy or diagnosis.  
- Use it alongside **CAF** (defines collapse) to understand the **transition to adaptation**.  
- Downstream tools (Signal Gating, Structural Karma, Theorein, Wager-as-Process Engine) are built inside EA.

## Relation to CAF  

| Aspect | CAF | EA |
|--------|-----|----|
| **Definition** | Boundary-condition: all anchors fail. | Adaptive framework: clarity after CAF. |
| **Focus** | Mapping failure. | Building survival logic. |
| **Nature** | Descriptive, structural. | Generative, adaptive. |
| **Role** | Explains collapse. | Provides operating model. |
| **Position** | Starting condition. | Upstream engine. |

## Note  
This repo is not static.  
**EA is a living system** â€” it will be updated as concepts evolve and as cross-framework integration develops.
