# Core Architecture v2.0

The system has six layers, powered by the **Wager-as-Process Engine (WPE):**

---

## 1. Wager-as-Process Engine (WPE)
- Dynamic core engine.  
- Runs on refusal of collapse + continuous seeking loop.  
- Converts micro-collapses into structural fuel.  

---

## 2. Mental Sovereignty
- Protects clarity and boundary integrity.  
- Buffers the fluctuations generated by WPE.  
- Prevents external fusion or internal overload.  

---

## 3. Signal Gating
- Filters and contains incoming signals.  
- Routes only what the WPE can metabolize.  
- Prevents distortion from breaching system clarity.  

---

## 4. Routing & Action
- Maps signals into action, expression, or containment.  
- Acts as the execution arm of WPE cycles.  
- Ensures feedback loops return usable information.  

---

## 5. Tension Release
- Dissipates pressure accumulated by WPE cycles.  
- Balances micro-collapse energy without full breakdown.  
- Maintains structural throttling capacity.  

---

## 6. Adaptation & Feedback
- Long-arc calibration of WPE cycles.  
- Mutation governance: distinguishes generative vs. harmful adaptations.  
- Ensures system evolves without distortion.
