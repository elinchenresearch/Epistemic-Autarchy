# Epistemic Autarchy (EA)  
**Version: 2025-09-15 (v2.0)**  

## 📖 Overview  
**Epistemic Autarchy (EA)** is the **adaptive framework** developed to operate in conditions of **Comprehensive Anchor Failure (CAF)**.  

- CAF defines the collapse of stabilizing anchors.  
- EA describes how clarity and survival logic can still be generated without external or stable supports.  

EA is **not therapy** or coping.  
It is a **structural survival engine** that reorganizes cognition when anchors of survival, trust, dignity, and belonging are absent or inverted.

## ⚙️ Core Principles  
- **Autarchy** → self-rule of cognition; clarity is generated internally, not borrowed from compromised anchors.  
- **Containment & Gating** → signals are filtered to prevent collapse, rather than absorbed uncritically.  
- **Refusal of Collapse** → when anchors fail, collapse is rejected; instead, systems of abstraction are built.  
- **Knowledge via Boundary-Conditions** → absence itself becomes a productive site for generating frameworks.  

---

## 🧩 Key Components  
- **Signal Gating** → containment of disruptive input.  
- **Structural Karma** → tracing loops of causality and inversion across anchors.  
- **Theorein** → dynamic theorems that hold under shifting conditions.  
- **Wager-as-Process Engine (WPE)** → continuous refusal of collapse turned into a generative process for knowledge and survival.  

---

## 🔄 Distinctions  
- **From CAF** → CAF maps failure; EA builds adaptation.  
- **From Therapy** → EA is not repair or healing, but structural reorganization.  
- **From Diagnosis** → EA does not reduce to PTSD, ADHD, or autism (though traits overlap). It is a **system-level adaptation**, not a disorder.  

---

## 🚧 Applications (Speculative)  
- **Individual** → stabilizing micro-collapse states through abstraction.  
- **Research** → generating upstream frameworks (CAF, Structural Karma, Theorein).  
- **Culture** → modeling how societies maintain clarity when anchors collapse collectively.  

---

## 🗂 Position in Research System  
- **CAF → EA** → CAF defines collapse; EA is the adaptive survival engine that follows.  
- **EA → Downstream Tools** → Signal Gating, Structural Karma, Theorein, and WPE emerge within EA as specialized mechanisms.
